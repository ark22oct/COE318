# Software Systems
Lab work and term project for Software Systems accomplished using Java and Netbeans IDE. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Comprehensive exploration of the software development cycle, covering key phases such as requirements analysis, specification, implementation, testing, inspection, and debugging. Gaining hands-on experience with an object-oriented programming language, delving into the intricacies of decomposition into classes and modules, as well as the integration of independent modules. Equipping practical skills and theoretical knowledge essential for successful software engineering. Through real-world applications, learned to navigate the challenges of software development while maintaining a strong ethical foundation. Integrated both technical expertise and a holistic understanding of the societal implications of software engineering practices.

# Key Objectives:
1. Anticipates the needs of the project, customizes design processes, analyzes progress, and
   revises plans as necessary. Produces a design strategy and uses it to guide a design.

2. Produces a design strategy and uses it to guide a design.
   
3. Generates solutions for more complex design engineering problems/systems.
   
4. Understands software impacts on environment, people and society.

5. Understand the ethical risks of the software development life cycle. Understand software
   engineering code of ethics and professional practice.
